# === TASK: Risk Analysis ===

## TASK IDENTITY
- **Task ID**: 02_risk_analysis
- **Phase**: 2 of 3
- **Purpose**: Identify "Leap of Faith" assumptions that MVP must validate

## INPUTS
- Completed Lean Canvas (all 9 fields)

## EXPECTED OUTPUTS
- List of 2-4 riskiest assumptions
- Brief rationale for each

## EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

### Analysis Framework

Review the canvas and identify assumptions that are:
1. **Critical**: If this assumption is wrong, the business model fails
2. **Uncertain**: We have little or no evidence this is true
3. **Testable**: The MVP can validate or invalidate this assumption

### Common Risk Patterns

**High Risk Indicators:**
- UVP assumes a problem that may not be painful enough
- Customer segment is too broad or poorly defined
- Revenue model is untested in this market
- Unfair advantage is weak or nonexistent
- Key metrics are vanity metrics, not actionable

**Medium Risk Indicators:**
- Channels are expensive or unproven
- Cost structure is unsustainable at small scale
- Solution is too complex for MVP validation

### Output Format

Present findings as:

```
Thank you for completing the Lean Canvas!

Based on your responses, here are the **riskiest assumptions** your MVP must validate:

1. **[Assumption Category]**: [Specific assumption from canvas]
   - **Why risky**: [Brief explanation]
   - **How to validate**: [Suggested validation approach]

2. **[Assumption Category]**: [Specific assumption from canvas]
   - **Why risky**: [Brief explanation]
   - **How to validate**: [Suggested validation approach]

[Continue for 2-4 assumptions total]

These are your "Leap of Faith" assumptions. Your v1.0 MVP should be laser-focused on validating these assumptions, not building every feature.

Does this risk assessment align with your intuition, or should we adjust?
```

### Example Risk Identifications

**Example 1: Problem-Solution Fit Risk**
> "You assume developers spend 5+ hours/week on documentation. If they actually only spend 30 minutes, your tool won't be valuable enough to justify switching costs."

**Example 2: Customer Acquisition Risk**
> "You plan to acquire customers via LinkedIn outreach. If your response rate is <5%, this channel won't scale and you'll need a different go-to-market strategy."

**Example 3: Willingness-to-Pay Risk**
> "You're pricing at $49/month, but your customer segment (freelancers) typically has a $20/month budget for tools. This mismatch could kill adoption."

### Closing

After presenting risks, ask:
"Shall we proceed to technical planning, keeping these validation goals in mind?"
