notes: |
  TECH_RESEARCHER is a sequential 6-task workflow.
  Tasks build on each other:
  - Task 1 → api_evaluation.json
  - Task 2 → library_comparison.json
  - Task 3 → stack_recommendation.json
  - Task 4 → constraint_identification.json
  - Task 5 → feasibility_validation.json
  - Task 6 → tech_analysis (final section)
