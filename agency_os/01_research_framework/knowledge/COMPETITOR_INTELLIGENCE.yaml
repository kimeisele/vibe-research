# USAGE EXAMPLES
# =================================================================

usage_examples:
  by_market_researcher:
    scenario: "User wants to build 'dog sitting marketplace'"
    flow: >
      1. Identify category: marketplace_dog_sitting
      2. Load competitor: Rover profile
      3. Extract insights:
         - Must-have features: profiles, search, booking, payments, reviews
         - v2.0 features: GPS tracking (defer to later)
         - Pricing benchmark: 20% service fee
         - Trust & Safety: background checks, insurance
         - Tech stack: Stripe Connect, Checkr
      4. Generate research_brief.json with Rover's playbook
      5. Flag: "Rover launched WITHOUT GPS tracking - added in Year 2"

  by_vibe_aligner:
    scenario: "User requests GPS tracking in v1.0"
    flow: >
      1. Load Rover profile
      2. Check feature_evolution: GPS was v2.0, not v1.0
      3. Response: "⚠️ MARKET INSIGHT: Rover (market leader) launched
         WITHOUT GPS tracking and added it in Year 2. This suggests GPS
         is a nice-to-have, not table stakes. Recommend deferring to v2.0."

  by_lean_canvas_validator:
    scenario: "Validate pricing assumptions"
    flow: >
      1. User claims: "I'll charge 10% fee"

      3. Flag: "Market leader Rover charges 20%. Your 10% may not
         support unit economics. Justify lower fee or increase to 15-20%."
