Feasibility Analysis Engine: A v1.0 Technical Constraint Knowledge Base




Introduction: Defining the FAE's Purpose - Codifying Architectural Wisdom


This report presents a foundational knowledge base of technical constraints for the Feasibility Analysis Engine (FAE). The purpose of this database is to provide the VIBE_ALIGNER AI system with a set of codified, machine-readable rules to programmatically enforce best practices in v1.0 software project scoping.
The primary driver of v1.0 project failure is a fundamental misunderstanding of the term "Minimum Viable Product" (MVP).1 Analysis of project post-mortems and architectural guidance reveals two common and catastrophic failure modes:
1. The "Minimum" Trap: This anti-pattern involves releasing a product that is merely "minimum" but not "viable." It is often buggy, unfinished, or of low quality, embarrassing the team and failing to provide a complete solution to any user, thus leading to immediate rejection.2
2. The "Viable" Trap: This anti-pattern involves founders and teams defining "viable" as their grand, complex, v2.0 vision. This leads to endemic "feature creep" 1 and "over-engineering" 8, resulting in bloated scopes, extended timelines, and budgets that are exhausted long before market validation can occur.1
The FAE's prime directive is to combat these anti-patterns. The constraints in this database are designed to guide the FAE in defining a "v1.0" not as a prototype, but as the smallest, simplest, and most complete version of the core value proposition for a specific, narrow audience.7
To achieve this, the FAE must be armed with rules that aggressively defend simplicity, favor monolithic architectures for initial development, and prioritize managed 3rd-party services over custom-built infrastructure. This database codifies architectural wisdom and common anti-patterns 10 into a set of actionable, preventative constraints.

Part 1: The v1.0 Scope-Violation Database (Feature Incompatibilities)


This section details features that are almost universally scope violations for a v1.0 product. These are "iceberg" features: the user request represents the 10% visible component (e.g., a "video chat" button), while the FAE must account for the 90% hidden complexity (e.g., media servers, transcoding, and network traversal infrastructure).


1.1 Real-Time and Interactive Features


Constraint: Real-Time Video Streaming (Self-Hosted)
A request for "live video streaming" is a classic v2.0+ feature. A v1.0 implementation requires a complex, multi-faceted infrastructure stack. For low-latency interactivity (e.g., video chat), WebRTC is required.12 WebRTC is peer-to-peer and does not scale to one-to-many broadcasting without a complex media server (SFU/MCU).12 Furthermore, WebRTC requires signaling servers to manage connections and STUN/TURN servers to traverse NAT firewalls.15 For one-to-many broadcasting, HLS/DASH is an alternative 15, but standard HLS has extremely high latency (30-60 seconds).16 Achieving Low-Latency HLS (LL-HLS) is possible but has been described as "heroic" to implement.16 This feature also requires on-the-fly video transcoding, often using tools like FFmpeg 15, and a CDN for distribution.15
* v1.0 Alternative: Pre-recorded video upload (which uses simple blob storage and a CDN) or embedding a 3rd-party service (e.g., Zoom SDK, Jitsi, or a platform like Owncast 19).
Constraint: Real-Time Chat (Self-Hosted)
This feature requires persistent WebSocket connections to manage state, user presence, and message history.20 This stateful architecture is fundamentally incompatible with standard serverless platforms (e.g., Vercel, AWS Lambda), which are stateless and have short execution limits.22 Building the necessary infrastructure to manage thousands of concurrent, persistent connections is "non-trivial".20 A survey of 500 engineering leaders found the average time to build this infrastructure in-house was 10.2 person-months.24
* v1.0 Alternative: Use a managed 3rd-party PaaS (e.g., Pusher, Ably 21, AWS AppSync 25, or Azure Web PubSub 20). A "minimum" v1.0 could also use asynchronous polling (e.g., refetching messages every 5 seconds).
Constraint: Real-Time Collaborative Editor
This feature (e.g., Google Docs-style collaboration) is one of the most complex in modern software. It requires solving distributed data synchronization with zero conflicts. This necessitates highly specialized, Ph.D.-level computer science algorithms, such as Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) 27 or Operational Transforms (OT). The complexity is exponential, not linear.
* v1.0 Alternative: A standard text-area field with a "last-write-wins" save model. For collaboration, implement document locking (e.g., "User X is currently editing this document").


1.2 Data-Intensive and AI Features


Constraint: AI/ML-Driven Recommendation Engine
This is a canonical v2.0+ feature. Its value is only realized at scale, with large user and interaction datasets.29 The primary v1.0 constraint is the "cold-start" problem: a new product has no users and therefore no data to train a model.30 The feature requires a massive data-gathering pipeline 29, complex ML models 32, and compute-intensive serving infrastructure.33 A v1.0's job is not to have a recommendation engine; its job is to collect the data that will one day train one.
* v1.0 Alternative: A manually curated list (e.g., "Editor's Picks," "Featured Items"). A simple "Most Popular" query (e.g., COUNT(*)). Integration with a 3rd-party service (e.g., Amazon Personalize 35).
Constraint: Custom Advanced Analytics Dashboard
This is a common "feature creep" trap.1 Teams build custom, complex dashboards 36 that are "overloaded with too much data" 37 and are ultimately "not being used".39 Building a custom dashboard in v1.0 is often a proxy for not knowing the key performance indicators (KPIs). The v1.0 goal is learning, and the correct approach is to use 3rd-party tools to discover the KPIs that will one day populate a v2.0 dashboard.7
* v1.0 Alternative: Integrate a 3rd-party analytics tool (e.g., Plausible 41, Google Analytics 42, Rybbit 43, Datapad 44).
Constraint: Self-Hosted Full-Text Search (Elasticsearch/Solr)
A user's request for "search" is often misinterpreted. A simple SQL LIKE query is trivial; a full-text search engine is not. True full-text search is "not an easy problem".45 It requires a dedicated, distributed system (e.g., Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, Solr).46 This infrastructure is I/O intensive 49, requires significant operational overhead (cluster management), and demands deep configuration of analyzers, tokenizers, and stoplists to function correctly.50 This is a "YAGNI" (You Ain't Gonna Need It) feature 52 for a v1.0's small data volume.
* v1.0 Alternative: Basic SQL LIKE or ILIKE queries. Use a database's built-in full-text search (e.g., PostgreSQL's tsvector). Use a managed 3rd-party service (e.g., Algolia 53, Meilisearch 48).


1.3 Enterprise-Grade Features


Constraint: Full Multi-Language Localization (i18n)
This is not simply "translating strings." It is a deep architectural commitment that affects every single UI component.56 It requires implementing an i18n framework (like i18next 59), integrating a Translation Management System (TMS) 59, and engineering complex logic for plurals, date/time formats, and number formats.56 Critically, it includes support for Right-to-Left (RTL) layouts (e.g., for Arabic), which can break an entire UI if not planned from day one.60 Retrofitting i18n into a v1.0 built without it can be "impossible".61
* v1.0 Alternative: An "i18n-ready" architecture. This means the application is English-only, but all user-facing strings are externalized into a single locale file (e.g., en.json). This adds near-zero overhead but makes the v1.5 localization effort (adding fr.json) trivial.
Constraint: Complex Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) / ABAC
v1.0 stakeholders often request "Google Docs-style" permissions ("User A can edit doc 1 but only view doc 2"). This is not simple RBAC. This is object-level, Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) or a complex hybrid.62 This type of system is "enormously complex" 64, leads to "role explosion" 65, and is a common source of security holes.62 A v1.0 needs authorization, not configurable permissions. The anti-pattern is building a UI for managing roles.
* v1.0 Alternative: Simple, hard-coded roles (e.g., admin, user).64 For a SaaS, this is typically owner and member. All permissions are checked in code (e.g., if (user.role == 'admin')), not from a complex permissions database.
Constraint: Offline-First Data Synchronization
This is a fundamental, not an incremental, architectural choice.67 It is not just caching static assets. It requires a local database (e.g., IndexedDB, SQLite) 27, a service worker for background sync 68, and, most importantly, complex data synchronization and conflict-resolution logic.71 This is a notoriously "hard problem" with "no standard solution".72
* v1.0 Alternative: An "online-first" architecture.67 The application requires an internet connection to function. A service worker can be used to cache static assets (JS, CSS) for faster load times, but not for application data.


1.4 Architectural Anti-Patterns (as Features)


Constraint: Microservice Architecture
This is the canonical v1.0 anti-pattern. Teams adopt it prematurely to avoid a "monolith" 73, but it is significantly harder to start with.75 It introduces immediate and immense complexity:
* Distribution: Remote calls are slow and fail in unpredictable ways.76
* Eventual Consistency: Distributed transactions are extremely difficult, forcing teams to manage eventual consistency, which is a source of subtle, dangerous bugs.76
* Operational Complexity: The v1.0 team must now manage dozens of services, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring systems instead of one.76
The benefits of microservices (independent deployment, team autonomy) only apply after an organization has scaled its team (Conway's Law 76), clarified its domain boundaries, and matured its operational practices.78 Martin Fowler, a major proponent, advocates for a "MonolithFirst" approach.79
* v1.0 Alternative: A well-architected Monolith.75 A monolith is easier to develop, deploy, test, and debug for a v1.0 team.80

Part 2: Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) Conflict Matrix


This section codifies the inherent tradeoffs in system design. A project cannot be fast, cheap, and good all at once. The FAE must use these rules to detect when a user's requirements are contradictory and force a tradeoff.


2.1 Performance vs. Cost and Simplicity


Constraint: Real-Time Performance vs. Serverless Architecture
This is a hard, technical conflict. A requirement for nfr_a: "real_time_performance_latency_<50ms" directly contradicts nfr_b: "serverless_architecture". Serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Vercel Functions) suffer from cold start latency, which can range from 100ms to over 3000ms.22 This makes them inherently unsuitable for stateful, hard real-time applications like WebSockets.22 This conflict forces the user to quantify "performance." If latency must be <100ms, a standard serverless architecture is not viable without costly workarounds (e.g., "provisioned concurrency") or managed services (e.g., AWS AppSync 25, Azure Web PubSub 20).
Constraint: High Availability (99.99%+) vs. v1.0 Budget
High Availability (HA) is a non-linear cost. "Five nines" (99.999%) of uptime is a common but misunderstood request. It requires a multi-region, active-active architecture.82 This directly conflicts with cost optimization. A multi-zone deployment is more expensive than a single-zone deployment. A multi-region deployment is significantly more expensive due to duplicated resources and, critically, inter-region data transfer costs.82 It also adds performance latency and operational complexity.82 A v1.0 should not aim for five nines. The correct, cost-effective v1.0 starting point is a single-region, zone-redundant deployment, which typically provides 99.9% ("three nines") uptime.82
Constraint: Web-Scale Scalability vs. v1.0 Simplicity
NFRs for horizontal, web-scale scalability 83 often lead teams to premature optimization, such as adopting microservices or complex event-buses from day one.8 Google's own architectural framework advises, "Simplify your design and use fully managed services".86 A v1.0 needs to be "scalable" (i.e., not fall over with 1,000 users) but not "web-scale" (i.e., handle 10 million users). The correct v1.0 architecture (a monolith on a vertically-scaled server or PaaS) can easily handle the load required for market validation.


2.2 Security vs. Usability and Speed


Constraint: High Security Compliance (HIPAA/GDPR) vs. Rapid Development
This is a critical, project-defining conflict. Compliance (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, PCI) is not a feature; it is an architectural constraint that affects the entire stack.87 It mandates specific technical controls (e.g., end-to-end encryption, detailed audit logs 88, granular access controls 89) and non-negotiable process controls (e.g., legal review, penetration testing).90 This can add 6-12 weeks or more to a project timeline. The FAE must flag this: a v1.0 should avoid handling regulated data (e.g., PHI, PII) if at all possible. If it cannot, the only viable v1.0 path is to build on a compliant platform (e.g., "HIPAA-eligible AWS services") and offload the burden to compliant 3rd parties (e.g., Stripe for PCI 81).
Constraint: Stringent Security vs. High Usability
This is a classic tradeoff.91 Forcing users to adopt complex password rules, short-lived sessions, and aggressive 2FA checks leads to "password-fatigue" and "decision-fatigue".93 This friction is a direct barrier to v1.0 adoption. For a v1.0, the goal is "secure defaults," not an impenetrable fortress. The balance should lean towards usability to encourage adoption, while mitigating critical, obvious risks.


2.3 Quality vs. Speed


Constraint: Internal Quality vs. Rapid Feature Development
This is the "Technical Debt" tradeoff, and it is the most misunderstood. The research is clear: this is a false tradeoff in the long term.94 Low internal quality ("cruft") does not make development faster. It makes development slower and more expensive.10 Startups that "pile features on a wobbly stack" 11 grind to a halt.
This constraint must distinguish between two types of debt:
1. "Good Debt" (Strategic): A conscious architectural choice. Example: "We will build a MonolithFirst 79 and accept the (good) debt of refactoring to microservices at 100 engineers."
2. "Bad Debt" (Cruft): A tactical, sloppy shortcut. Example: "We will copy-paste this code 97 and skip writing unit tests to meet this deadline."
The FAE should allow strategic debt (e.g., deferring a v2.0 feature) but flag "cruft-based" debt. High internal quality (automated tests, refactoring) is an enabler of sustainable speed, not an obstacle to it.95
________________


Part 3: Technology Stack and Infrastructure Constraints


This section provides binary, foundational rules for the FAE. These are the "Required Technical On-ramps" (RTOs) for features and the "Incompatible Technology" (IT) pairings.


3.1 Stack Incompatibilities


Constraint: WebSockets vs. Standard Serverless Functions
This is a common and critical v1.0 stack conflict.
* technology: "websockets" (for real-time chat, live updates)
* incompatible_with: ["serverless_lambda_aws", "serverless_vercel_functions"]
* Reason: Serverless functions are stateless and have a maximum execution duration (e.g., 10-60s for Vercel, 15 min for Lambda).22 WebSockets require a persistent, stateful server connection. The serverless model is fundamentally unsuited for managing these persistent connections.
* Workarounds (which the FAE should suggest):
   1. Use a managed 3rd-party service (e.g., Pusher, Ably 21).
   2. Use a cloud-specific managed WebSocket service (e.g., AWS API Gateway WebSocket 25, Azure Web PubSub 20).
   3. Use a "sidecar" dedicated server (e.g., a small container or EC2 instance) only for the WebSocket connections, which communicates with the serverless backend.
Constraint: Monolithic Architecture vs. Polyglot Development
A key benefit of a monolith is its simplicity and shared codebase.80 An attempt to write different modules of the same monolith in different languages (e.g., Python for the API, Go for a processing module) defeats the purpose and creates a complex "distributed monolith" anti-pattern. Technology diversity is a "pro" of microservices 76, but an "anti-pattern" for a monolith.
* technology: "monolithic_architecture"
* incompatible_with: "polyglot_programming_stack"
* Reason: Defeats the primary benefit of a monolith: a single, unified codebase, deployment, and testing model.
* Workarounds: Choose one primary backend language for the v1.0 monolith.


3.2 Minimum Infrastructure RTOs (Required Technical On-ramps)


Constraint: Self-Hosted Payment Form (PCI DSS)
This is a "Trojan Horse" constraint. If a user specs feature: "custom_payment_form" where credit card data (PAN, CVC) hits the v1.0 server, this creates an implicit, non-negotiable dependency on nfr: "pci_dss_compliance_level_1". This is a massive security and infrastructure burden, mandating over 300 security controls, firewalls, encryption-at-rest, access logging, and regular external audits.81
* Workarounds (which the FAE must enforce for v1.0): Use a "low risk integration" 81 that keeps card data off the v1.0 server.
   1. Stripe Elements: Provides customizable UI components (inputs, buttons) that live in an iframe, so card data goes directly to Stripe.
   2. Stripe Checkout / PayPal Redirect: A fully hosted page managed by the payment provider.99
Constraint: WebRTC Infrastructure
As established in Part 1, a WebRTC feature is not standalone.
* technology: "webrtc"
* requires_infrastructure: ["signaling_server", "stun_server", "turn_server"]
* Reason: WebRTC requires these services for peer-to-peer connection negotiation and NAT traversal.12
Constraint: HLS Video Streaming Infrastructure
* technology: "hls_video_streaming"
* requires_infrastructure: ["media_server", "transcoding_service_ffmpeg", "cdn"]
* Reason: HLS requires video to be transcoded (e.g., with FFmpeg) into multiple bitrates and served from a CDN via a manifest file.15
Constraint: OAuth (Social Login) Infrastructure
* technology: "oauth_social_login"
* requires_infrastructure: ["oauth_provider_api_keys", "secure_callback_url_handler", "secure_token_storage", "account_linking_logic"]
* Reason: Requires correct implementation of complex OAuth 2.0/OIDC protocols 100 and, critically, logic to handle account linking/merging.101

Part 4: Complexity and Dependency Chain Analysis


This section provides the FAE with rules to understand multiplicative complexity. Features are not additive; they are exponential.6 Adding one "simple" feature can double or triple the complexity of another by introducing hidden tasks.
For example, a user may plan Task A: Basic Auth (1 week) and Task B: Google Login (1 week), estimating 2 weeks. This is incorrect. Adding Google Login (OAuth) 101 creates a new, complex, and "hidden" task: Task C: Account Linking (1 week). This task answers the question, "What if a user signs up with email, then logs in with Google using the same email? How do you link them?" This hidden task is the "complexity multiplier".105

      * Adds Dependencies: stripe_connect_integration, kyc_onboarding_flow, payment_splitting_logic, tax_reporting_1099_logic
      * Reason: An order of magnitude more complex. Involves legal, tax, and complex fund-splitting.

* Base Feature: basic_crud_feature (e.g., "Projects")
* Base Dependencies: api_endpoints, database_table, ui_view

      * Multiplier: $1.4x$
      * Adds Dependencies: audit_log_table, logging_logic_on_all_mutations
      * Reason: Requires intercepting every C/U/D operation to log "who, what, when."
   * Trigger: real_time_updates
      * Multiplier: $2.5x$
      * Adds Dependencies: websocket_connection, pub_sub_system, ui_real_time_subscription
      * Reason: Adds real-time infrastructure complexity to a simple CRUD app.20
   * Trigger: offline_sync
      * Multiplier: $4.0x$
      * Adds Dependencies: local_database_indexeddb, service_worker_sync_logic, conflict_resolution_logic
      * Reason: Can add 3-5 weeks of development time per feature.105 Fundamentally changes architecture.72

Part 5: Feature Time-Estimation Database


This section provides a baseline of time estimates for common, well-defined v1.0 feature "quanta." These are not guarantees 110, but "sanity check" boundaries for the FAE.
The research shows a large variance in estimates. A "YOLO" Stripe integration is "half an hour" 112, but a proper, robust integration is "a couple of weeks".112 Basic authentication is estimated at 7.5 days using PERT 114, but a full implementation (with email validation, password reset, etc.) is "weeks".115 This database codifies the proper, robust estimate, as the FAE's purpose is to prevent low-quality, "Minimum" v1.0s.4 Estimates assume a single, experienced developer.
