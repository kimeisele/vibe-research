Automated Prioritization & Complexity Engine Rules




This knowledge base is designed to fuel the Automated Prioritization & Complexity Engine (APCE).




It provides a research-backed, standardized system for estimating feature complexity,




assessing business value, and negotiating v1.0 scope.

scoring_system:
scale_type: "Modified Fibonacci (Relative Complexity)"
scale:
unit: "Complexity Points"
description: >
Complexity Points are a relative measure of the work involved, not a direct
translation to hours. This scale is used because it reflects the increasing
uncertainty and risk inherent in more complex tasks.1
A score of '1' represents the simplest possible complete task (e.g., a basic CRUD operation).
A '13' or '21' represents an "Epic" that is poorly understood and must be
broken down further.






basis: >
 Scores are a composite of three factors [3, 4, 5]:
 1. Complexity: How difficult is the logic?
 2. Effort: How much work is it?
 3. Risk & Uncertainty: How many unknowns are there?

multiplier_logic:
type: "Compounding"
formula: "Final_Score = base_complexity * multiplier_1 * multiplier_2"
description: >
Complexity multipliers are compounding, not additive.6 This models
the real-world scenario where risks amplify each other.
Example: A feature (3 pts) with a legacy integration (2.0x) and high
technical debt (1.5x) is 3 * 2.0 * 1.5 = 9 points, not 3 + 2.0 + 1.5 = 6.5.


SECTION 1: Base Complexity Scores




Provides baseline complexity scores for 50+ common software features.




'base_complexity' is the score for the simplest, viable v1.0 implementation.




'multipliers' represent common additions that escalate this to a v2.0+ feature.

Note: These scores are not static. 'Delighters' decay into 'Performance'




and then 'Must-Bes' as markets mature.

"Thank you for this comprehensive vision. I've run these 30 features through the APCE to build our v1.0 plan.
To ensure a strong, stable, and timely launch, the engine prioritizes the list based on a 'Value vs. Effort' analysis.122 Here is the v1.0 scope it recommends:
MUST HAVE (v1.0 Core) - {count} features:
{list_must_haves}
SHOULD HAVE (v1.0 Goals) - {count} features:
{list_should_haves}
COULD HAVE (If Time Permits) - {count} features:
{list_could_haves}
WON'T HAVE (Planned for v2.0) - {count} features:
{list_wont_haves}
This focused scope delivers the core value proposition 135 first, allowing us to launch and get real user feedback.105 The v2.0 items are our top priority for the next planning cycle.
Does this v1.0 scope look like a strong foundation we can build on?"

At our current 125% 'Must Have' budget, we have no buffer and are already over timeline.
We need to work together to re-classify at least {count} of these 'Musts' to 'Shoulds'. Can we review the list and find the ones that aren't absolutely critical for a Day 1 launch?"

You're right, a simple 'One-Time Payment' feature is an {8}-point task.
