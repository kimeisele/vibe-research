# Deep Research Report: Hardening Governance Blindspots for Production Readiness
# Extracted Configuration Blueprint for Phase 2 Implementation

governance_mandate:
  phase_transition:
    from: Policy_Definition (Static)
    to: Mechanical_Enforcement (Runtime_Integration)
  critical_assets:
    - 17 Knowledge Base (KB) files
    - Core Ontology Schema
    - All Governance Configuration files
  guiding_principle: "Fail Safe, Roll Back Fast"

governance_blindspots:
  - blindspot_id: 1
    name: Configuration_Drift_and_Ownership_Gaps
    mitigation:
      codeowners_strategy:
        assignment_mandate: Mandatory assignment of Curators
        best_practice: Utilize named groups (@org/team-name) over individual usernames
        enforcement_mechanism: Strict Branch Protection rules on all base branches
        enforcement_condition: Pull Requests must receive approval from designated CODEOWNER(s)
        scaling_method: Widespread use of wildcard patterns (* and directory-level paths)
      sre_validation_checks:
        - check_type: Syntax_Schema_Check
          mechanism: CI Linter, Schema Validator (e.g., semantic_audit.py)
          failure_response: Halt CI/Deployment. Alert Curator/CODEOWNER
          governance_layer: Configuration Layer
        - check_type: Semantic_Drift_Check (Size_Delta)
          mechanism: Configuration Differential Check
          alert_condition: File size delta > 50% decrease OR file becomes zero/empty
          failure_response: Continue serving previous validated configuration; Alert SRE
          governance_layer: Operational Layer 3
        - check_type: Rollback_Readiness_Drill
          mechanism: Automated weekly/bi-weekly forced rollback simulation
          failure_response: Halt all new deployments; Alert SRE team immediately
          governance_layer: Operational Layer 5

  - blindspot_id: 2
    name: Regression_and_Semantic_Quality_Assurance
    mitigation:
      kb_deployment_pipeline:
        architecture: Pipeline_as_Code (Version-controlled)
        stages:
          - CI_Stage: Execute automated validation (Table 1 checks)
          - Staging_Acceptance: Deploy to isolated environment; Execute Acceptance Tests & Semantic Regression Testing (SRT)
          - Canary_Deployment: Progressive rollout to small, segmented user group
      semantic_regression_testing:
        mechanism: Semantic_Snapshotting
        process:
          - Execute Evals on current production KB (Baseline metrics)
          - Execute same Evals on proposed new KB artifact
          - Strict_Gate: Cannot merge if statistically significant regression in established metrics is detected
        monitoring_metrics:
          - Retrieval_Quality: Precision@K, Recall@K
          - Generation_Coherence: ROUGE
          - Operational_Metrics: Latency, Error Rates

  - blindspot_id: 3
    name: Ontology_and_Structured_Data_Evolution
    mitigation:
      versioning_policy:
        standard: Mandatory Semantic Versioning (SEMVER) (Major.Minor.Patch)
        major_increment: Reserved for backward-incompatible (breaking) changes
        minor_increment: Reserved for backward-compatible feature additions
        patch_increment: Reserved for non-structural content fixes/bug remediation
      immutability_principle:
        mandate: Previous versions must remain immutable
        implementation: New version treated as distinct document with new identifier; linked back using properties (e.g., owl:priorVersion)
      migration_tooling_analogy:
        mechanism: Versioned "migration scripts" or auditable change logs

  - blindspot_id: 5
    name: Unchecked_Autonomy_and_AI_Slop_Prevention
    mitigation:
      confidence_based_escalation:
        high_stakes_decisions:
          threshold: ">= 90%"
          action_upon_failure: Immediate Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Escalation
        routine_decisions:
          threshold: ">= 75%"
          action_upon_failure: Flag for Asynchronous Human Review Queue
        configuration_write_back (KB updates):
          threshold: ">= 95%"
          action_upon_failure: Discard automated output; Fall back to manual review by designated CODEOWNER
      guardrails_against_slop:
        threat: Model collapse from recursively training on low-quality AI content
        defense: Automated changes to 17 KB files must pass the highest confidence threshold (95%+) and be subject to explicit guardrail agents

rag_system_governance:
  config_management:
    prompts_and_config: Must be treated as critical, versioned assets under source control
    prompt_regression_testing: Mandatory for any change to KB or RAG configuration
  context_engineering_strategy:
    eager_loading_mandate: For high-utility, stable content (core instructions, tool definitions)
    lazy_loading_restriction: Reserved for optional, one-to-many collections or uncertain usage
  performance_slis:
    accuracy_retrieval: Precision@K, Recall@K, ROUGE
    operational_performance: Latency (end-to-end), Cost-per-query
    vector_db_choke_point: Rapid retrieval of similar vectors (low-latency retrieval)
  caching_invalidation:
    mechanism: Prompt Caching (Semantic Caching)
    invalidation_blindspot: Serving stale data from previous KB version
    architectural_linkage: Any SEMVER version change (patch, minor, major) to KB/ontology schema MUST automatically trigger targeted cache invalidation or complete flush
