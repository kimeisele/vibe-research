PROJECT 1: Srila Prabhupada Quote of the Day

CATEGORY: Simple CLI Tool
COMPLEXITY: Low
ESTIMATED COST: $1-2

USER REQUEST:
I want a simple command-line tool that shows a random quote from Srila Prabhupada's books each day.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Display a new quote every day at startup
- Show the source (which book, chapter)
- Allow filtering by book (e.g., only Bhagavad-Gita quotes)
- Work offline once quotes are downloaded
- Be written in Python

TARGET USERS: Devotees who work on terminal/command line

TEST FOCUS:
- Can MARKET_RESEARCHER find similar tools (quote apps)?

- Quality of generated tests?

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
✅ feature_spec.json includes offline capability
✅ Generated code is runnable Python CLI
✅ Tests cover main functionality
✅ Documentation explains how to add new quotes
