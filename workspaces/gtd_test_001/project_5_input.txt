PROJECT 5: Vaishnava Book Library Manager

CATEGORY: Complex Desktop App
COMPLEXITY: High
ESTIMATED COST: $3-5

USER REQUEST:
Desktop application for managing a personal library of Vaishnava literature.
Features:
- Catalog physical books (title, author, ISBN, location in library)
- Track borrowed books (who borrowed, when, reminders)
- Reading lists and progress tracking
- Notes and highlights per book
- Search and filter (by author, topic, language)
- Export library catalog
- Barcode scanner integration (optional)
- Multi-user support (family library)

TARGET: Windows/Mac/Linux users with large Vaishnava book collections
Preference: Electron or native app, local-first data storage

TEST FOCUS:
- Can MARKET_RESEARCHER find similar library management software?
- Does VIBE_ALIGNER scope complex features (multi-user, barcode)?
- Does TECH_RESEARCHER evaluate local-first vs cloud storage?
- CODE_GENERATOR: Can it handle complex desktop app architecture?

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
✅ Scope negotiation defers barcode/multi-user to Phase 2
✅ Tech stack decision is well-reasoned (Electron vs Tauri vs Native)
✅ Feature spec includes data backup strategy
✅ Generated code has proper desktop app structure
